tin

These are instructions for games that can be played with components
fit into an altoids tin.  Indeed, the resulting pdfs are sized to fit
in an altoids tin as well.  The components include (mini) dice, (mini)
pens/pencils, a (mini) deck of cards, and a (mini) pencil sharpener.
The only additional component needed for some games is paper. Graph
paper is preferable.

files:
	readme
	mkfile
	tin.so
	cards.tin
	.gitignore

The pdfs are generated from ps generated from neatroff source files.
Thus the following tools are required to build the pdfs:

neatroff:	litcave.rudi.ir/neatroff.pdf
	needs neatroff, neatpost, and 9tbl
ps2pdf: 	ghostscript.com
plan9 mk:	9fans.github.io/plan9port/unix

Overview:
tin.so has the formatting macros for all the pdfs.  *.tin provides one
genre of games and builds to *.pdf.  The mkfile automates the process, but in a pinch, the following command will generate the pdf from the tin file:

9tbl < [tinfile.tin] | neatroff | neatpost -p 508x762 | ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dEmbedAllFonts=true - [pdffile.pdf]
